# Gradual vs Sudden Perspective

## Summary

There are two perspectives. The “Gradual perspective” which is about you, as a person, making some effort to change something. By your efforts you gradually improve whatever it is you put your mind to, and work to gradually work towards freedom. The “Sudden perspective” does not allow any illusions at all, and doesn’t give you anything to work with, but it still provides freedom.

## Practices

Gradual Perspective: If you identify a particular behaviour, you can follow it down to where it originates and destroy the root energy, freeing you from that particular pattern.

Sudden Perspective: Mind is root, with no characteristics, not even emptiness, that has no branches.

## Examples

Applied to a particular problem: “I am procrastinating on my work.”

Gradual perspective: Identify why you are procrastinating and notice what is arising in your body. Then focus on processing/destroying that energy or allowing it to pass through another channel.

Sudden perspective: There is no existent structure for behaviour or concepts to fit into. Things do not occur as knowable entities, and you are an object arising without relation to anything.

Gradual result: Release of energies and processing, slowly, with intention, that results in a feeling of relief.

Sudden result: More powerful release of energies and processing, on a broader scale and instantaneous without intention. 

There is no intentionality in the sudden perspective it happens automatically and of itself. That doesn’t mean that you’re not able to instigate it though, you just cannot do so with intention. That’s where things get mystical and esoteric, you can’t communicate to yourself or to others how it’s done, but nevertheless it is done, and you had a part in it. But the part that you played is not totally clear, and it would be righter to say that the universe played a larger part in it than you did. Nevertheless, you are able to instigate it. I cannot say how.
