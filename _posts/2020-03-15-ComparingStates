# The Absurdity Of Comparing, Or Wanting, A State

Comparing mental states, or spiritual advancement is absolutely absurd. The reason its absolutely absurd is because your body is wholly individual. It has no cultural aspect. The state that you’re in, producing from, or advancing towards has no cultural content at all. The only cultural thing that exists is the illusory relations that are made between things, resulting in blocks in the body. There is no way to compare apples to oranges in a meaningful way.

The reason that it is appealing to compare mental states or spiritual advancements is because the cultural artifacts created by the individuals in those states have particular attributes. Because you want those particular attributes, and the artifacts are a part of culture, you are interested in their state. Because you are interested in their state from a cultural perspective, you perceive their state to also be a cultural artifact. But it is not, it is a product of a completely independent and culturally unrelated body, that is completely incomparable.

That doesn’t mean you can’t impersonate the cultural artifacts, or even experience the things that other people have said they experience, but that doesn’t resonate with your body. It doesn’t feel true because it’s not true, it’s an imitation of a cultural artifact. There is no way for you to actually experience what anyone else has experienced, or actually enter the state that anyone else is in. Their body is just too unique for that. You would have to impersonate every cell.

You can broadly brush your own experiences into similar cultural artifacts, and compare notes to spur each other on, but you push each other on in a totally independent way. There isn’t any mutual experiencing going on. There is just the momentum of energy in both people pushing each individual body towards its own results. There is no group body.

Thanks for reading I appreciate it.
