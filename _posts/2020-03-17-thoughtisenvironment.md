# Thought is Environment

## Introduction

This is a post about a particular type of thought, and one that is present in a lot of "habitual" type mentalities, where you recognize your habits, things that trigger those habits, and you try to work from there. I think that this is fundamentally an impossible view, because there is no distinction between the environment and your thoughts.

## Main Post

The standard view is that there are particular environments or spheres, e.g. twitter, and that thoughts are contained or related to that sphere. Vice versa, there is the thought that particular thoughts activate that sphere. However, there is no containment or causation distinction in mind, as mind works moment-to-moment, and does not come from itself. It comes from the immediate present that has no objects. Thoughts that occur, even if they are of a contained or related phenomena, do not have any reality to them, despite those thoughts occurring.

Thought is environment. Environment does not trigger thought, and thought does not trigger environment. The moment that environment exists, thoughts exist, the moment that thoughts exist, environment exists. You cannot escape your own perceptions into external things, or attribute your own perceptions to external things. Your own perceptions are those external things, regardless of how your energy is projected inward or outward.

The refined view is that each thing that occurs is everything inside of it. In this view, there isn’t even a distinction of thoughts or not thoughts, or a relation of the senses to each other. This may seem like it is impossible to act on or with, because it’s impossible to grasp. The reality is this is the natural state that you’re acting in all the time, and the only reason that you do not accord with it is because you perceive thoughts that present an alternative dualistic reality to be real and tangible, existent in reality. It’s not that perceiving them as unreal will help either, it’s just that any thought once it's lost its controlling power will no longer determine your perceptions or actions. This loss of control is the piercing of illusion, it’s not about shifting the thoughts one way or another way, it’s about fundamentally recognizing their nature and the nature of mind and allowing that to take its own place.

## Addendum

There is no way that anything can exist without already existing. You have no place making anything occur. There is no thing that makes other things occur outside of what is already doing that. There is no control, and there is no entity that needs control, and there is nothing to be controlled. You exist within your own plane, which has no direction or momentum and cannot be perceived or recognized. There is only the things that already exist. You cannot know what exists.
